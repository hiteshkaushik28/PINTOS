# PINTOS
Pintos is a simple operating system framework for the 80x86 architecture. It supports kernel threads, loading and running user programs, and a file system, but it implements all of these in a very simple way. Pintos projects are run on a system simulator, that is, a program that simulates an 80x86 CPU and its peripheral devices accurately enough that unmodified operating systems and software can run under it. Using the QEMU simulator is recommended. This assignment requires a thorough understanding of the OS and creativity in designing your approaches to solve the problems.
